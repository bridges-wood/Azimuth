Conventions:
	Comments should always be marked with a date and the name of the person writing.
	All names (as in variables for objects) should be written with a Capital First Letter.
	Variable names and Class names should be written in camel case.
	To format code after typing, Ctrl + Shift + F should be used to format the spacings and indentation uniformly.
	
	Any parts of a class that need to be finished in a later session should be marked with a comment and TODO as 
	the first word. This information should be added to the Commit Message to allow other team members to work on it.
